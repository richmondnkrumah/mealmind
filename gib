Excellent. A well-crafted onboarding flow is the most effective way to communicate your app's value and set the user up for success. We will design a flow that is visually engaging, concise, and seamlessly transitions into the mandatory authentication step.

Here is the detailed, three-screen onboarding flow for MealMind.

Onboarding Philosophy: The "Problem, Solution, Benefit" Arc

The most effective onboarding tells a story. Our three screens will follow this classic narrative structure to build desire and justify the need for an account.

Screen 1: The Problem: We acknowledge the user's pain point.

Screen 2: The Solution: We introduce our app as the magical solution.

Screen 3: The Benefit: We show the user the positive outcome they will achieve.

UI Components & Mechanics

Visuals: We will use Lottie animations. They are lightweight, look incredibly professional, and are more engaging than static images or heavy videos.

Layout: Consistent across all three screens.

Top 70%: Reserved for the large Lottie animation.

Bottom 30%: Contains the Title, Subtitle, and navigation controls.

Navigation:

A Progress Indicator (3 dots) will be present to show the user where they are in the flow.

A circular button with a right-arrow icon will serve as the "Next" button.

On the final screen, this button will change to a text-based "Get Started" button.

Screen-by-Screen Breakdown
Screen 1: The Problem ("The Daily Struggle")

Lottie Animation: A character looking thoughtfully at an empty dinner plate, with various food items (a fish, a carrot, a carton of milk) and question marks floating around their head in a confused swirl. The animation is gentle and slightly playful.

Title:

Tired of "What's for Dinner?"

Subtitle:
Meal planning can feel like a daily chore. We get it. Let's make it effortless.

Progress Indicator: ● ○ ○ (First dot is active)

Navigation: A circular button with a right-arrow icon.

Screen 2: The Solution ("The Magic of AI")

Lottie Animation: A smartphone animates into view. Its camera "scans" a fridge, and digital lines flow out from the phone, connecting to icons representing a recipe book and a shopping list. This visually demonstrates the AI process in a simple, dynamic way.

Title:

Plan Your Week in a Snap

Subtitle:
Our AI scans your pantry, finds recipes you'll love, and builds your smart shopping list—all in seconds.

Progress Indicator: ○ ● ○ (Second dot is active)

Navigation: A circular button with a right-arrow icon.

Screen 3: The Benefit ("The Perfect Outcome")

Lottie Animation: A calendar for the week animates onto the screen. Each day (Mon-Fri) gets populated with a beautiful, appetizing food illustration. The animation ends with a satisfying checkmark appearing over the completed calendar.

Title:

Eat Well, Waste Less

Subtitle:
Get ready for a week of delicious meals, perfectly planned. Let's create your account to get started.

Progress Indicator: ○ ○ ● (Third dot is active)

Navigation: A prominent, full-width button with the text "Get Started". This clearly signals the end of the onboarding and the beginning of the action.

The Final Step: The Authentication Screen

Tapping the "Get Started" button navigates the user to this compulsory screen. It must be as frictionless as possible.

Visual: The MealMind logo is displayed prominently at the top.

Title:

Welcome to MealMind

Subtitle:
Create an account to save your meal plans, preferences, and pantry items.

Primary Actions (Social Logins):

A large, platform-styled button: "Continue with Apple" (for iOS).

A large, platform-styled button: "Continue with Google" (for both).

These should be the most visually appealing options, as they are the easiest for the user.

Secondary Action (Email Sign Up):

A text input field for "Email."

A text input field for "Password."

A primary-colored button with the text "Sign Up with Email."

Tertiary Action (Log In):

At the very bottom, a small text link: "Already have an account? Log In". This is crucial for returning users.

This entire flow effectively educates the user, builds excitement, and seamlessly channels them into the required sign-up process. It respects their time while clearly communicating the app's value proposition before asking for their commitment.
